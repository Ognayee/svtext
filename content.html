        Listen to what Sophie says to Marius. <span audio="audio\1278_AV_1.mp3" start=00:00:04.971 end=00:00:07.961>She's
            talking
            about her journey to work</span> on her first day, and she's thinking about how to travel into the city.
        Listen for
        the words she uses about travelling: traffic, crowded, noisy, modern. <span audio="audio\1278_AV_1.mp3"
            start=00:00:26.257 end=00:00:30.366>What is she talking about when she uses these words?</span> Then use the
        information to write an
        email to her friend Jackie.

        <span audio="audio\1279_AV_1.mp3" start=00:00:00.431 end=00:00:05.856>Read the text about travelling into and around
            the
            city.</span> What are the different ways you can travel in a city if you don't go by car? What's the most
        popular
        way in your city? Many people go by bus or train, but many people also go into town with their bikes, because
        the
        traffic is bad. What do you do?
